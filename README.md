# Welcome to Axial

Axial is a [_**Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**_](https://snowballs.gitbook.io/snowball-docs/resources/defi-glossary#decentralized-finance-defi) protocol built on the Avalanche blockchain. It is a fully decentralized and self-contained application, and is the centerpiece for liquidity of value-pegged assets on the ecosystem. It was launched on November of 2021, and is one of many projects originating from the [**Snowball DAO**](https://snowball.network).

## **Core Features**

**Swapping** - Swap between stablecoins, bridged assets, wrapped assets, synthetic assets or derivatives with Axial, with significantly reduced fees compared to traditional DEXs.

**Providing Liquidity** - Provide liquidity to the protocol and earn risk-averse returns through others utilizing your liquidity to perform trades, as well as AXIAL token incentives.

## Why use Axial over other DEXs?

If you're looking for liquidity for most assets, there are amazing DEXs on Avalanche such as Trader Joe or Pangolin. Axial is focusing on providing liquidity for value-pegged assets, which means we can provide the following benefits to our users:

* Drastically lower swap fees for these value-pegged assets.
* Much lower slippage on high-volume trades.
* Little to no impermanent loss when providing liquidity.
