## Welcome!

At Snowball's DeFi University we explore the world of decentralized finance, and learn all about the many innovations it is bringing to the financial industry, as well as everything we need to know in order to make the best decisions possible when it comes to money. And who knows, maybe you'll come out knowing something you didn't before.

We sure aren't qualified to give financial advice, but everything at SDU should give you the context and knowledge necessary to know what tools are available to you and for you to do your own research.

## Course Structure

Our courses are split into four different categories, each encompassing an aspect of DeFi - from the underlying blockchain technologies that made it possible, to the many unique governance structures that have sprouted from the various decentralized applications over the years:

* **Fundamentals (FN)** - Explores the underlying technology and concepts of DeFi.
* **Yield Farming (YF)** - Covers the different yield farming strategies available in DeFi.
* **Governance (GV)** - Goes over the many governance structures ruling over decentralized apps.
* **Extracurricular (EX)** - Extra; NFTs, decentralized gaming, anything at all.

There is no specific order that these categories should be explored in, although the course's year level will indicate how complex its concepts are. Feel free to take a peek at some of the topics within each year level and choose some that interest you. Or pick something you've never heard of! Maybe you'll learn something interesting.
