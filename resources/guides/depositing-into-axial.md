# Depositing into Axial

This guide covers how to deposit into StableVault. This example uses the s4D StableVault, which is a four-way liquidity pool between DAI.e, FRAX, TUSD, and USDT.e.

You need at least one of the pool's coins to deposit.

1\) First, you will need to acquire one of the four [_**stablecoin**_](https://snowballs.gitbook.io/snowball-docs/resources/defi-glossary#stablecoin) tokens; **DAI.e**, **FRAX**, **TUSD**, or **USDT.e**. You can have **any combination** and **any amount** of these tokens to deposit.

2\) Head to the [**s4D StableVault**](https://app.snowball.network/s4d-vault) page on the Snowball website.
