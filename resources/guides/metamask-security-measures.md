## Locking Your Wallet

When not using your computer, and especially if you are not accustomed to locking your computer when walking away from it, it is highly advised to lock your wallet to not allow others nearby to make any transactions you are not aware of.

This is as simple as clicking on your account icon on the top right and selecting **Lock**:
