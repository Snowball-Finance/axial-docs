# Manual Smart-Contract Interaction

In the rare case something happens to Snowball's website, you can always interact with our contracts through a block explorer. This guide will cover how to deposit funds into our contracts, claim your SNOB rewards and withdraw from our contracts without relying on our beautiful web interfaces.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're planning on interact with deprecated contracts, all the addresses you'll need can be found [**here**](broken-reference) instead of our usual compounding contracts page.
{% endhint %}

## Depositing into Compounding Strategies

1\) If depositing LP tokens, first supply liquidity to a pool on [**Pangolin**](https://app.pangolin.exchange/#/png/1) or [**Trader Joe**](https://www.traderjoexyz.com/#/pool) that receives rewards.

2\) Find the contract address for the pool you deposited into and open it on a [**C-Chain block explorer**](https://snowtrace.io). On Pangolin, this can be found on their [**analytics page**](https://info.pangolin.exchange/#/home). On Trader Joe, this can be found through their [**pools page**](https://www.traderjoexyz.com/#/pool).

3\) Once you have found it, click on **Write Contract**.

5\) Find the **Approve** method; it is usually the 1st method. In the first box - _spender(address)_ - you will need to input Snowball's **compounding deposit contract** for the token pair you'd like to compound. This can be found on our [**Compounding Contracts page**](broken-reference). In the second box - _value(uint256)_ - add an arbitrarily large number, such as 999999999999999999999999999.

6\) Click **Write**. You will be asked to approve the transaction through your wallet.

**Never deposit tokens directly into a compounding gauge contract. Doing so will lead to a loss of funds.** Steps 9 and 14 are to deposit into the compounding deposit contract and compounding gauge contract respectively. These need to be followed in order.
{% endhint %}

9\) Click **Write**. You will be asked to approve the transaction through your wallet.
