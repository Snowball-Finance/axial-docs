# Our Team

Axial's team includes much of the development, design, marketing and other staff from Snowball's team. More info on such team can be found [**here**](https://snowballs.gitbook.io/snowball-docs/resources/our-team).

As Axial matures, it will likely elect its own council, and recruit its own developers to form a team separate from its creators from Snowball.
Our team is made up of a large assortment of talented individuals from the community, who have contributed to making Snowball the platform it is today.
